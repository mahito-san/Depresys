# DEPRESYS
A chat application prototype for
real-time analysis of mental health conditions based
on Bangla text messages

## Abstract
The paper highlights the increasing prevalence of
mental health concerns in today’s society, worsened by factors
such as work-life imbalance, financial struggles, and strained
personal relationships compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The impact of these issues can lead to physical health problems,
addiction, and suicide. Increasing awareness and access to mental
health services is vital to address these concerns. This paper’s
primary focus is to explore achieving a sense of well-being
through Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). A high-fidelity
prototype of a chat application named DEPRESYS has been
developed to demonstrate how the system will work, offering real-
time analysis of mental health conditions based on Bangla text
messages. The paper highlights the significance of prioritizing
mental well-being as much as physical health for leading a
balanced and satisfying life. A cognitive walk-through method
was used to evaluate the system’s effectiveness, where we acted
as users to interact with the system and highlight problems
accordingly. Overall, the system is pretty efficient and works very
smoothly. Various users had various kinds of user experiences,
some problems that users’ highlighted were resolved and the User
Experience was tailored according to the users’ needs.
